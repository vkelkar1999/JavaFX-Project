Robert said this was code that he deleted, so I deleted it but put the code here as a backup.



public class Collision {
	

	// Takes the x and y arrays for the fish and hook object, loops through them and returns true
	// if both some x and some y in the fish and hook objects are equal to each other
	public boolean checkCollision(int[] fishXArr, int[] fishYArr, int[] hookXArr, int[] hookYArr) {
		
		boolean xColl = false;
		boolean yColl = false;
		
		for (int x1 = 0; x1 < hookXArr.length; x1++) {
			for (int x2 = 0; x2 < fishXArr.length; x2++) {
				if (hookXArr[x1] == fishXArr[x2])
					xColl = true;
			}
		}
		
		for (int y1 = 0; y1 < hookYArr.length; y1++) {
			for (int y2 = 0; y2 < fishYArr.length; y2++) {
				if (hookYArr[y1] == fishYArr[y2])
					yColl = true;
			}
		}
		
		
		
		
		return xColl && yColl;
	}
